## 📍 Step-by-Step: See Meter Correlation on Maps

### Method 1: OMS Dashboard - Geographic View (Recommended)

#### **Step 1: Access the Dashboard**
1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to: **http://localhost:9200**
3. The dashboard will load with multiple tabs

#### **Step 2: Go to the Map Tab**
1. Click on the **"Map"** tab in the navigation
2. The interactive map will load showing:
   - 🔴 **Outage Events** (with severity colors)
   - ⚡ **SCADA Events** (substations/feeders)
   - 📡 **Smart Meters** (Kaifa meters)
   - 📶 **ONU Devices** (fiber network)
   - 📞 **Call Center Reports** (customer tickets)
   - 👥 **Crew Locations** (field teams)

#### **Step 3: View Meter Correlation**

**NEW FEATURES YOU'LL SEE:**

✅ **Substation-to-Meter Links**
- When you click on a SCADA event (substation marker)
- Popup now shows:
  - Total meters under this substation
  - How many meters are offline
  - Which specific meters are affected
  - Links to view affected customers

✅ **Meter Status Indicators**
- Meters are now color-coded:
  - 🟢 **Green**: Online and communicating
  - 🔴 **Red**: Offline (no power or communication)
  - 🟡 **Yellow**: Unknown status
  - 🔵 **Blue**: Recently changed status

✅ **Correlated Outage Clusters**
- Circular overlays show outage areas
- Size indicates number of affected meters
- Color indicates severity based on offline meter count

## 🔧 Testing the New Features

### Test Scenario: Create a Test Outage

#### **Step 1: Insert Test Data**

```sql
-- Create test substation with meters
INSERT INTO network_substations (substation_id, name, location_lat, location_lng)
VALUES ('SS_TEST', 'Test Substation', 31.9500, 35.9300)
ON CONFLICT (substation_id) DO NOTHING;

-- Create test meters
INSERT INTO oms_meters (meter_number, substation_id, feeder_id, location_lat, location_lng, power_status, communication_status)
SELECT 
    'M_TEST_' || LPAD(generate_series::TEXT, 3, '0'),
    (SELECT id FROM network_substations WHERE substation_id = 'SS_TEST'),
    NULL,
    31.9500 + (random() * 0.01),
    35.9300 + (random() * 0.01),
    CASE WHEN random() > 0.7 THEN 'off' ELSE 'on' END,
    CASE WHEN random() > 0.7 THEN 'offline' ELSE 'online' END
FROM generate_series(1, 20);

-- Link meters to substation
INSERT INTO network_substation_meters (substation_id, meter_id)
SELECT 
    (SELECT id FROM network_substations WHERE substation_id = 'SS_TEST'),
    id
FROM oms_meters
WHERE meter_number LIKE 'M_TEST_%'
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
```

#### **Step 2: Trigger SCADA Event**

Send a test SCADA event through the producer or directly:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9086/scada/outage \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "eventType": "breaker_trip",
    "substationId": "SS_TEST",
    "feederId": "FD_TEST",
    "mainStationId": "MS001",
    "alarmType": "fault",
    "timestamp": "'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'",
    "voltage": 0.0,
    "severity": "critical",
    "reason": "Test meter correlation visualization",
    "coordinates": {
      "lat": 31.9500,
      "lng": 35.9300
    }
  }'
```

#### **Step 3: View on Map**

1. **Refresh the dashboard**: http://localhost:9200
2. **Go to Map tab**
3. **You should see**:
   - New red marker at Test Substation
   - 20 meter markers around it (some red, some green)
   - Circular overlay showing affected area
   - Click markers to see correlation details

## 🎯 Real-World Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Storm Response

**Before Meter Correlation:**
- Operators see 5 SCADA alarms
- Manually estimate 500 customers affected
- Deploy crews based on guesswork

**After Meter Correlation:**
- Map shows 5 substations with outages
- Automatic meter check: 487 meters offline
- Map displays precise customer locations
- Crews dispatched to densest areas first

### Use Case 2: Planned Maintenance

**View maintenance impact:**
```sql
-- Show which meters will be affected by planned substation maintenance
SELECT 
    ns.substation_id,
    ns.name,
    COUNT(m.id) as total_meters,
    ARRAY_AGG(m.meter_number) as meter_list,
    ST_AsGeoJSON(ST_Collect(ST_Point(m.location_lng, m.location_lat))) as meter_geojson
FROM network_substations ns
JOIN network_substation_meters nsm ON ns.id = nsm.substation_id
JOIN oms_meters m ON nsm.meter_id = m.id
WHERE ns.substation_id = 'SS001'
AND m.location_lat IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY ns.id, ns.substation_id, ns.name;
```

### Use Case 3: Customer Inquiry

**Customer calls about outage:**
1. Operator searches meter number on map
2. Sees meter status: Offline
3. Views linked SCADA event
4. Sees 44 other meters offline in same area
5. Informs customer: "Substation issue, crew en route, ETA 2 hours"

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Map Issues

### Issue: No Meters Showing on Map

**Check 1: Are meters in database?**
```bash
psql -U postgres -d oms_db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM oms_meters WHERE location_lat IS NOT NULL;"
```

**Check 2: Are meters linked to substations?**
```bash
psql -U postgres -d oms_db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM network_substation_meters;"
```

**Fix: Run migration if counts are 0**
```bash
cd d:/developer/jepcox/apisix-workshop
psql -U postgres -d oms_db -f construction/oms_meter_migration_script.sql
```

### Issue: Substations Show 0 Meters

**Check topology:**
```sql
SELECT 
    ns.substation_id,
    COUNT(nsm.meter_id) as meter_count
FROM network_substations ns
LEFT JOIN network_substation_meters nsm ON ns.id = nsm.substation_id
GROUP BY ns.substation_id;
```

**Fix: Populate mappings**
```sql
-- Link meters to nearest substation
INSERT INTO network_substation_meters (substation_id, meter_id)
SELECT DISTINCT
    (SELECT id FROM network_substations 
     ORDER BY haversine_distance_meters(
         location_lat, location_lng,
         m.location_lat, m.location_lng
     ) ASC LIMIT 1),
    m.id
FROM oms_meters m
WHERE m.location_lat IS NOT NULL
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
```
